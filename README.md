# MidtermProject
This project is a Full Stack Java/SpringMVC/JPA group project.

# Description
This project was created as a possible solution to the mandatory reporting for Police Officers in the State of Colorado in reference to the new Colorado Legislative Bill SB20-217. This bill required certain things to be documented on every officer initiated contact. There are not many documentation programs for police officers that are mobile-friendly so we focused on making this program user-friendly across multiple platforms.

It features:
- Database schema
- Create/Read/Update/Delete operations on database objects
- User login authenticated by MySQL table
- login users connected to all people they contact and input
